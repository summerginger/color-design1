## Color Design System from [Code Cademy projects](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-color-design/projects/journey-world-color)
In this project, I will use the knowledge that I gained on color theory and apply it to a simple web page. I will take an existing grayscale website, select a color scheme(monochromatic design) from https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel , and apply the colors to various elements and sections within the design.

I will use the color wheel tool to determine the color scheme and properly pair colors together. When applying colors to the page, I will select a dominant color with additional supporting colors that provide structure to the design.
